## Project status

This is a **work in progress** project, which I am using to put in practice new things that I
have learned (ideas, patterns, styles, etc), do/re-do stuff in small steps, test interesting
packages, etc.

At the time of writing, there is not an official application available in neither of the two
platforms targeted by [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), Android or iOS. I
hope to release it in a near future, at least the Android version which is the one that is being
used for testing.

Meanwhile, if you are a developer or have enough knowledge for it, you can build it following the
[Build process](#build-process) section.

## Background / Motivation

During August of 2017, I was going with my brother on the same bus to our jobs. There, I noticed
that every morning he made a couple of calculations and finally I ended asking him about them, just
out of curiosity :)

He explained to me, with a lot of details, for what and why those calculations were necessary, why
he wanted to have the best accurate dose, blah blah blah, and also told me that he was working in a
Google Sheet to facilitate himself his work. Next weekend, I could not stop myself from making a
small proof of concept<sup><a href="footnote-1">1</a>, <a href="footnote-2">2</a></sup> that later
became, progressively, in this small ~~application~~ *pet project* to start the development of an
mobile application with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Want to know more?

If you are curious about the [theory behind it](docs/RADIOISOTOPES.md), do not hesitate to read the
documentation.

## Roadmap <small>(or simply "pending tasks")</small>

There is a lot of room for both, to have a complete, functional application and to improve it
progressively. In order to not pollute the README, I will put the roadmap in the
[backlog](https://github.com/dgdavid/dose-calculator/projects/1).

do this pet project possible. Doubtless, it would've been easier for him to keep alive his Google Sheet
document.
